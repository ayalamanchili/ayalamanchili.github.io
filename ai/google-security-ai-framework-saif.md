# üîê Google SAIF (Secure AI Framework) ‚Äì Summary

**SAIF** is Google‚Äôs proposed **Secure AI Framework** designed to help organizations **secure AI systems** in a structured and comprehensive way. It builds on Google's security expertise and aligns with secure software development practices, adapted specifically for AI/ML systems.

---

## üéØ SAIF Goals

- Provide a **security-by-design** approach for AI.
- Address emerging **AI-specific threats** (e.g., prompt injection, model theft).
- Guide organizations in building and maintaining **trustworthy AI systems**.

---

## üß± Core Pillars of SAIF

### 1. Secure the AI System Architecture

- Apply **Zero Trust** principles to AI pipelines.
- Ensure **segmentation**, **least privilege**, and **secure interfaces** (e.g., APIs).

### 2. Secure the AI Supply Chain

- Validate and verify **data**, **models**, and **dependencies**.
- Use **software bills of materials (SBOM)** and **signed artifacts**.
- Prevent **data poisoning** and model tampering.

### 3. Secure the AI Model

- Protect models from:
  - **Adversarial inputs**
  - **Prompt injection**
  - **Model inversion and theft**
- Implement **robustness testing**, **model watermarking**, and **access controls**.

### 4. Secure the AI Usage

- Monitor and control **inputs and outputs**.
- Implement **rate limiting**, **policy enforcement**, and **content filtering**.
- Defend against abuse like **jailbreaking** and **misuse of outputs**.

### 5. Secure the Deployment Environment

- Harden infrastructure: secure model hosting, inference APIs, and GPU/TPU environments.
- Use **encryption in use**, **confidential computing**, and **MLOps security**.

### 6. Secure the People and Processes

- Define clear **roles/responsibilities** for AI security.
- Train developers and operators on **AI risks and response**.
- Conduct **red teaming**, threat modeling, and **incident response planning**.

## ‚úÖ Key Principles Behind SAIF

| Principle              | Description                                                  |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Defense in Depth**   | Layered security across the entire AI lifecycle              |
| **Threat-Informed**    | Uses real-world threats and frameworks like MITRE ATLAS      |
| **Built-in Security**  | Security from the start‚Äînot bolted on later                  |
| **Adaptable**          | Works across organizations of different sizes and industries |
