# üîê AI LLM Security Program Framework

## 1. Define the Scope & Governance
- **Inventory LLM systems**: Catalog all AI/LLM use cases, including models used (OpenAI, open-source, fine-tuned models, etc.).
- **Establish governance**: Assign ownership (e.g., AI Security Lead), roles, and responsibilities.
- **Create policies**: Align with internal security policies and external standards (e.g., NIST AI RMF, ISO 42001).

---

## 2. Threat Modeling for LLMs
Perform **LLM-specific threat modeling**:
- Prompt injection
- Data leakage/memorization
- Jailbreaks / evasions
- Hallucinations and misinformation
- Model poisoning / training attacks
- Over-reliance & automation bias

Use STRIDE/PASTA adapted for AI systems.

## 3. Secure LLM Lifecycle (SDLC + ML Lifecycle) (MLS-SDLC)

### üß™ Model Development & Training
- Ensure **clean, vetted, and privacy-compliant datasets**.
- Monitor for **poisoned data** or backdoor injections.
- Apply **differential privacy**, **data minimization**, and **redaction**.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Model Deployment
- Use **zero-trust architecture** principles.
- Apply **model sandboxing and isolation**.
- Rate-limit and monitor inputs/outputs.
- Use **prompt filters**, **content moderation**, and **guardrails** (e.g., OpenAI Moderation API, Anthropic Constitutional AI).

### üîÅ Post-deployment Monitoring
- Monitor for:
  - Prompt injection attempts
  - Abuse and adversarial usage
  - Drift and performance degradation
- Implement **audit logging** and **response workflows**.

---

## 4. Access & Identity Management
- Restrict API/model access using IAM roles.
- Use **fine-grained RBAC** for devs, testers, ops, and consumers.
- Ensure **token-level and prompt-level auditability**.

---

## 5. Data Security & Privacy
- Apply encryption at rest/in transit.
- Prevent sensitive data leakage:
  - Prompt input scanning
  - Output redaction
- Consider **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** to isolate sensitive data from the model.

---

## 6. Application & Prompt Security

 - Prompt design controls: content policies, system prompts governance, secrets never placed in prompts.
 - Prompt injection defenses: input/output filtering, allow-lists for tools/functions, constrained tool use, content       provenance checks.
  - Jailbreak/abuse controls: safety middleware, guardrails, refusal patterns, rate shaping, ‚Äúdo/ask‚Äù separation.
  - Response hardening: structured output schemas, JSON schema validation, function call constraints, output encoding to prevent XSS/HTML injection.

RAG security: retrieval allow-listing, per-doc ACL enforcement, query rewriting protections, metadata-based access checks.

## 7. LLM Security Testing
- Red team your model with:
  - Adversarial prompts
  - Prompt injection tools (e.g., `PromptBench`, `Gandalf`, `OpenAI Eval Framework`)
- Use scanning tools:
  - [üîç LLM Guard](https://github.com/prompt-security/llm-guard)
  - [üîç Guardrails AI](https://github.com/ShreyaR/guardrails)
  - [üîç Microsoft PyRIT](https://github.com/Azure/pyrit)
- Integrate security checks into **CI/CD pipelines**.

---

## 8. Incident Response Plan for AI Systems
 - Playbooks: jailbreak/prompt-injection containment, model rollback, cache purge, vendor key rotation.
 - Detection: detectors for policy-violating outputs, anomalous usage, data egress spikes.
 - Forensics & evidence: prompt/output traces, tool call logs, model/version IDs, retrieval docs.

---

## 9. Compliance, Legal, and Ethics
- Align with:
  - NIST AI RMF
  - EU AI Act
  - ISO/IEC 27001 + 42001
  - SOC 2/3, HIPAA, or other industry-specific frameworks
- Perform **AI Risk Assessments**.
- Ensure model transparency, fairness, and bias evaluations.

---

## 10. Awareness & Training
- Train developers on AI risks.
 - Secure prompt/use training for engineers and business users.
- Educate end users on **safe prompt usage**, model limitations, and potential abuses.
- Run internal workshops and phishing-style exercises for prompt injection awareness.

---

## 11. Continuous Improvement
- Establish KPIs:
  - Number of blocked jailbreak attempts
  - Prompt anomaly rate
  - Drift in output safety scores
- Conduct periodic reviews and external assessments.
