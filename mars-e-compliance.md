<h3 id="what-is-mars-e-">What is MARS-E ?</h3>
<p>Minimum Acceptable Risk Standards for Exchanges (MARS-E) is a set of privacy and security standards for Affordable Care Act (ACA) administering entities.<br>
This framework establishes the security and privacy requirements required for compliance under MARS-E, ensuring the availability, confidentiality, and integrity of protected health information (PHI), personally identifiable information (PII), and federal tax information (FTI).<br>
All Exchanges and Healthcare organizations implementing ACH are required to have both external and external assessments to validate, identify and remediate gap to maintain compliance.</p>

<p>Developed by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), the standards are based on the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication 800-53.</p>

<h3 id="mars-e-assessment-procedure">MARS-E Assessment Procedure</h3>
<ul>
<li>Review current system documentation, policies, Implementation and other information to evaluate the implementation of MARS-E controls.</li>
<li>Conduct Interview with respective personnel responsible for each control to validate and gather evidence</li>
<li>Create Test cases for all controls to validate the implementation of the control</li>
<li>Run Test cases  on the system to validate and document any gaps identified.</li>
<li>Document control evaluation notes, interview and test case notes for each control as needed.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="additional">Additional</h3>
<ul>
<li>Create Security Assessment Plan (SAP) with all Applications, Roles, Infrastructure, Databases, Others in scope.</li>
<li>Identify all infrastructure and software assets in scope</li>
<li>Perform vulnerability (credentialed)  and compliance scans on all systems including database, application, web and more.</li>
<li>Perform web application OWASP based web security testing, using tools and manual process.</li>
<li>Perform Active scans reports for all applications in scope</li>
<li>Perform Application Penetration Testing and capture results</li>
<li>Perform SAST scans for application code</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="delivery-and-next-steps">Delivery and Next Steps</h3>
<p>Identify and filter the false positives from all the scans and reports.<br>
Create a third-party Security Assessment Report (SAR). This report will include a detailed explanation of your controls, as well as testing procedures and results. This report can be submitted to the CMS when applying for an Authorization to Operate (ATO).</p>
