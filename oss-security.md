## SCA vs SAST
- More than 90% of all modern web applications use some open source dependencies.
- The average software uses around 148 open source components
- Growing vulnarabilities with open source librabies and raise in with supply chain attacks.

## How to identify and remediate OSS vulnarabilities.
- Run SCA/OSS scan along with SAST scans early on in the SSDLC.
- This helps to identify addition of vulnarabilaties early on and block deployment of code to higher environments.

## What are the various options to run SCA/OSS scans.
 - Open Source
  - Dependency checker
  - Github
  - Gitlab
    
 - Commercial
  - Blackduck
  - Contrast
