###  Understand what data you have.
Depending on the compliance regulations they are subject to, organizations might need to protect cardholder information (PCI DSS), health records (HIPAA), PII of EU residents (GDPR) or other data. Data discovery and classification tools can help you locate regulated data so you can ensure it is protected by appropriate security controls and is trackable and searchable as required.

### Conduct regular risk assessments.
Regular risk assessment is a central mandate of many compliance regulations. At a high level, risk assessment involves identifying risks, assessing the probability of their occurrence and their potential impact, taking steps to remediate the most serious risks, and then assessing the effectiveness of those steps.

### Develop a clear plan.
Most regulations require a combination of administrative, physical and technical measures, such as policies and procedures, employee training, and IT controls. Managing all of that effectively requires a clear plan. Use existing checklists to see where your company stands and consider using a standard framework as a starting point for designing a data protection policy.

### Do extra reading.
Many resources are available to make regulations more understandable. For example, this comprehensive guide developed by the UK’s Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) answers the most common questions about GDPR compliance.


### Get advice.
If you have more questions than answers and your company does not have an internal compliance officer, consider engaging external advisors who have expertise with the specific regulations your organization is subject to. Professional advice can help you adjust your information security program faster and more effectively, saving you money in the long run.
